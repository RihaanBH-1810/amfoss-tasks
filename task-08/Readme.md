## Poke-Search !!

* This task was very interesting as I grew up watching pokemon.<br>
* I followed all the instructions to setup up the task.<br>
* Learnt how pyside6 and requests works.<br> 
* I used the Docs of pyside6 as reference as well.<br>
* And then i used the main.py as reference to understand to complete the search window file.<br>
* It was very satisfying to watch work properly in the end.<br>
