# My approach for this task :

* It took me some time to learn about how chrome extension, DOM, JS works and what is DOM. <br>
* First I made the Basic html webpage , and css for it.<br>
* created the manifest file.<br>
* Created the js script which takes data from the openweathermap api and formats the data to readable form.<br>
* Linked the script to the html file. <br>
* Loaded the extension to chrome.<br>
