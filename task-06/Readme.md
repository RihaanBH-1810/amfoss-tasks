## Link to my discord server which has the bot

https://discord.gg/CxPfQseB

### My approach for this task

* Setup a virtual env to develop the project<br>
* First i learnt about BS4 and build a scrapper which scrspped the live scores of the live or most recent match from the ESPN website.<br>
* After that i learnt how to build a discord bot using python with the discord library<br>
* Then i added the part where my scrapper could save files into a CSV file<br>
* I integrated the bot and the scrapper<br>
* The bot is deployed in a server that me and my school friends had made<br>
* Right now my bot has all the basic functionalities mentioned in the task i wanted to add more but i didn't get the time to do so<br>
