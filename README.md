# SELF INTRO
Hello everyone
I am Rihaan B H from S1 Robotics and artificial intelligence engineering(RAE).I've been programming since high-school and I came to know of open source software first when started to tinker with arduino and I would like to make my own contribution to the open source community.I like problem solving and my interests lie in python,c++ programming ros systems and computer vision applications but I'm open to any other domain I'm assigned to.My hobbies are swimming,football, tinkering with arduino boards and other small electronics.
