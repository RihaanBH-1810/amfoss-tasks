# Task-04
##### By far this is the hardest task in comparison to the other tasks :

_I had solved a few problems in codeforces before, but these questions were a lot harder than those i had tried_<br>
_Initially i had a lot of confidence in my CP skills these questions made me realise that my CP skills were non-existent :(_<br>

##### I could solve only six questions , and in three other questions my code was clearing only the test case zero

* _Initially i tried to solve the quesiton in C++ but it didn't work properly then i had to switch to python._<br>
* _I wrote down a vague algorithm for the question on a page then started to work on it on python tutor interpreter_<br>
* _I used python tutor to visualize how my algorithm was bieng implemented_<br>
* _I tried my best to learn as much as i could and completed those 6 questions_
