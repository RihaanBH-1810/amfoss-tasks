# By far this is the hardest task in comparison to the other tasks :

_I had solved a few problems in codeforces before, but these questions were a lot harder than those i had tried_<br>
_Initially i had a lot of confidence in my CP skills these questions made me realise that my CP skills were non-existent :(_<br>

#### I could solve only six questions , and in three other questions my code was clearing only the test case zero

**I used python tutor to visualize how my algorithm was bieng implemented**<br>
**Initially i tried to solve the quesiton in C++ but it didn't work properly then i had to switch to python.**<br>
**I tried my best to learn as much as i could and completed those 6 questions**
