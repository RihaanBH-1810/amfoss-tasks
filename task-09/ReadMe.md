# GeoQuest 

**This task took a lot of time but in the end when the app finally worked, it was very satisfying.**<br>

* Installing flutter took 6 hours because i had a few errors and solving it took time<br>
* After installing flutter i went through the docs of flutter.<br>
* I followed few tutorials and made a small app, so that i could learn what flutter is.<br>
* Then i started going through the osm docs.<br>
* It took a lot of time for me to even load a basic map.<br>
* Once i got the map running rest of the things were comparitively easy to implement.<br>
* At last i implemented the Spinkit loader.<br>
* This is one my favourite tasks because it worked in the end.<br>
