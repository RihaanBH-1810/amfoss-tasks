## Task-05

#### My approach :

* I had some idea about HTML but i had never used CSS.<br>
* I learnt the basics of CSS.<br>
* Implemented the page first.<br>
* Then learnt about CSS grids and implemented the shop page<br> 
* This task took me some time because somehow it took me a long time to understand css but after i got used to it, it was relatively easy.<br>
