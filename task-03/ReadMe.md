#My approach to this task :
###Step 1:
**Firstly i wrote a basic algorithm to find and print all the prime numbers upto given number N.**

###Step 2:
**I used W3 Schools to go through the Syntax of the languages mentioned.**

###Step 3:
**Installed compilers/Interpreters of the languages mentioned.**<br>
**Although for some languages I did use online compilers.**<br>

###Step 4:
**Directly implemented the Algorithm into Program in the easier languages**<br>
_Although i struggled with functional programming (elixir and haskell) for a few days i finally got it working somehow_<br>

###Step 5:
**Pushed the programs in to the GitHub repo.**
